ChIJ6yqKy1Brpw0RcZYFaDmLq6k,CFG Bank - Agency Rabat Souissi,CFG Bank - Agency Rabat Souissi,"Km 3.5 Av. Mohammed VI, Rabat, Morocco","I am extremely disappointed with the service offered by this agency. To certify a check, I followed their instructions and submitted an application as requested. However, they required that this request be written on letterhead, which seems unnecessary and unjustified to me in this specific case.

I had to wait a very long time for a service that was nevertheless simple. The staff was unwelcoming and unprofessional. My problem was only taken seriously after the intervention of an influential lady in the field, which is unfortunate for an ordinary customer.

As a customer, I expected more serious, rapid and respectful treatment.
This experience left me with a very negative impression, and I am now considering other banking options if improvements are not made.

I hope that the bank will take concrete measures to strengthen the quality of its services and better meet the expectations of its customers in the future.",1,2025-01-15 10:24:06

As a customer, I expected more serious, rapid and respectful treatment.

My experience with BMCE bank services, specifically in Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. It's honestly a 10/10 for terrible service! üò†
First off, the ATM situation is a complete disaster. In both Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, it seems like all the machines are constantly out of service! üíî I've encountered this multiple times, just like the picture shows with the ""D√©sol√© Ce GAB est hors service"" message.
Frankly, it's shocking. We see Morocco investing heavily in the Digital Vision 2030 and preparing for major events like the World Cup üåç‚öΩÔ∏è, aiming for modernity and development. Yet, banks like this still feel stuck in the past, failing to provide even basic, reliable services like working ATMs. It feels like there's been NO development compared to the national progress. üìâ
Adding to the frustration, the bank has been closing many branches. Losing local agencies, like the one mentioned in Khouribga, makes accessing banking services even more difficult for customers. üè¢‚ùå
On top of the poor access and unreliable machines, the bank packages are more expensive than they should be üí∏, offering little value for the cost.
Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding the insurance services offered by this bank. Questions about their legality ü§®‚öñÔ∏è‚ùì have made me, and likely others, very uneasy.
Overall, the service quality at BMCE in these areas is unacceptable. The lack of functioning ATMs, branch closures, high costs, and unclear situation with insurance show a serious disconnect from customer needs and the country's digital aspirations. Major improvement is desperately needed! üò°üõ†Ô∏è",1,2025-04-22 14:47:43

ChIJfxwU45fSpw0RGJTC51J3tUo,BMCE BANK OF AFRICA,BMCE BANK OF AFRICA,"140 Bd Hassan II, Casablanca 20320, Morocco","BMCE Service in Fquih Ben Salah & Khouribga: Absolutely Unacceptable! üò°üëé (10/10 BAD!)
My experience with BMCE bank services, specifically in Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. It's honestly a 10/10 for terrible service! üò†
First off, the ATM situation is a complete disaster. In both Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, it seems like all the machines are constantly out of service! üíî I've encountered this multiple times, just like the picture shows with the ""D√©sol√© Ce GAB est hors service"" message.
Frankly, it's shocking. We see Morocco investing heavily in the Digital Vision 2030 and preparing for major events like the World Cup üåç‚öΩÔ∏è, aiming for modernity and development. Yet, banks like this still feel stuck in the past, failing to provide even basic, reliable services like working ATMs. It feels like there's been NO development compared to the national progress. üìâ
Adding to the frustration, the bank has been closing many branches. Losing local agencies, like the one mentioned in Khouribga, makes accessing banking services even more difficult for customers. üè¢‚ùå
On top of the poor access and unreliable machines, the bank packages are more expensive than they should be üí∏, offering little value for the cost.
Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding the insurance services offered by this bank. Questions about their legality ü§®‚öñÔ∏è‚ùì have made me, and likely others, very uneasy.
Overall, the service quality at BMCE in these areas is unacceptable. The lack of functioning ATMs, branch closures, high costs, and unclear situation with insurance show a serious disconnect from customer needs and the country's digital aspirations. Major improvement is desperately needed! üò°üõ†Ô∏è",1,2025-04-22 14:47:43

Mohammed VI, Rabat, Morocco","I am extremely disappointed with the service offered by this agency. To certify a check, I followed their instructions and submitted an application as requested. However, they required that this request be written on letterhead, which seems unnecessary and unjustified to me in this specific case.

I had to wait a very long time for a service that was nevertheless simple. The staff was unwelcoming and unprofessional. My problem was only taken seriously after the intervention of an influential lady in the field, which is unfortunate for an ordinary customer.

As a customer, I expected more serious, rapid and respectful treatment.
This experience left me with a very negative impression, and I am now considering other banking options if improvements are not made.

I hope that the bank will take concrete measures to strengthen the quality of its services and better meet the expectations of its customers in the future.",1,2025-01-15 10:24:06

My experience with BMCE bank services, specifically in Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. It's honestly a 10/10 for terrible service! üò†
First off, the ATM situation is a complete disaster. In both Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, it seems like all the machines are constantly out of service! üíî I've encountered this multiple times, just like the picture shows with the ""D√©sol√© Ce GAB est hors service"" message.
Frankly, it's shocking. We see Morocco investing heavily in the Digital Vision 2030 and preparing for major events like the World Cup üåç‚öΩÔ∏è, aiming for modernity and development. Yet, banks like this still feel stuck in the past, failing to provide even basic, reliable services like working ATMs. It feels like there's been NO development compared to the national progress. üìâ
Adding to the frustration, the bank has been closing many branches. Losing local agencies, like the one mentioned in Khouribga, makes accessing banking services even more difficult for customers. üè¢‚ùå
On top of the poor access and unreliable machines, the bank packages are more expensive than they should be üí∏, offering little value for the cost.
Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding the insurance services offered by this bank. Questions about their legality ü§®‚öñÔ∏è‚ùì have made me, and likely others, very uneasy.
Overall, the service quality at BMCE in these areas is unacceptable. The lack of functioning ATMs, branch closures, high costs, and unclear situation with insurance show a serious disconnect from customer needs and the country's digital aspirations. Major improvement is desperately needed! üò°üõ†Ô∏è",1,2025-04-22 14:47:43

ChIJfxwU45fSpw0RGJTC51J3tUo,BMCE BANK OF AFRICA,BMCE BANK OF AFRICA,"140 Bd Hassan II, Casablanca 20320, Morocco","BMCE Service in Fquih Ben Salah & Khouribga: Absolutely Unacceptable! üò°üëé (10/10 BAD!)
My experience with BMCE bank services, specifically in Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. It's honestly a 10/10 for terrible service! üò†
First off, the ATM situation is a complete disaster. In both Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, it seems like all the machines are constantly out of service! üíî I've encountered this multiple times, just like the picture shows with the ""D√©sol√© Ce GAB est hors service"" message.
Frankly, it's shocking. We see Morocco investing heavily in the Digital Vision 2030 and preparing for major events like the World Cup üåç‚öΩÔ∏è, aiming for modernity and development. Yet, banks like this still feel stuck in the past, failing to provide even basic, reliable services like working ATMs. It feels like there's been NO development compared to the national progress. üìâ
Adding to the frustration, the bank has been closing many branches. Losing local agencies, like the one mentioned in Khouribga, makes accessing banking services even more difficult for customers. üè¢‚ùå
On top of the poor access and unreliable machines, the bank packages are more expensive than they should be üí∏, offering little value for the cost.
Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding the insurance services offered by this bank. Questions about their legality ü§®‚öñÔ∏è‚ùì have made me, and likely others, very uneasy.
Overall, the service quality at BMCE in these areas is unacceptable. The lack of functioning ATMs, branch closures, high costs, and unclear situation with insurance show a serious disconnect from customer needs and the country's digital aspirations. Major improvement is desperately needed! üò°üõ†Ô∏è",1,2025-04-22 14:47:43

I had to wait a very long time for a service that was nevertheless simple. The staff was unwelcoming and unprofessional. My problem was only taken seriously after the intervention of an influential lady in the field, which is unfortunate for an ordinary customer.

As a customer, I expected more serious, rapid and respectful treatment.

My experience with BMCE bank services, specifically in Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. It's honestly a 10/10 for terrible service! üò†
First off, the ATM situation is a complete disaster. In both Fquih Ben Salah and Khouribga, it seems like all the machines are constantly out of service! üíî I've encountered this multiple times, just like the picture shows with the ""D√©sol√© Ce GAB est hors service"" message.
Frankly, it's shocking. We see Morocco investing heavily in the Digital Vision 2030 and preparing for major events like the World Cup üåç‚öΩÔ∏è, aiming for modernity and development. Yet, banks like this still feel stuck in the past, failing to provide even basic, reliable services like working ATMs. It feels like there's been NO development compared to the national progress. üìâ
Adding to the frustration, the bank has been closing many branches. Losing local agencies, like the one mentioned in Khouribga, makes accessing banking services even more difficult for customers. üè¢‚ùå
On top of the poor access and unreliable machines, the bank packages are more expensive than they should be üí∏, offering little value for the cost.
Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding the insurance services offered by this bank. Questions about their legality ü§®‚öñÔ∏è‚ùì have made me, and likely others, very uneasy.
Overall, the service quality at BMCE in these areas is unacceptable. The lack of functioning ATMs, branch closures, high costs, and unclear situation with insurance show a serious disconnect from customer needs and the country's digital aspirations. Major improvement is desperately needed! üò°üõ†Ô∏è",1,2025-04-22 14:47:43

Unfortunately, none of his employees bother to answer the bank's phone. I don't think they have this task in their job description list.
